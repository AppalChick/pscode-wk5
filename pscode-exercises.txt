// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 numbers together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask for a number
divide number by 2
    IF result is an integer
        print "Even"
    ELSE
        print "Odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask for 5 numbers
add the five numbers together for sum
    sum = y
divide y by 5 for average
    average = x

designate each of the 5 numbers in the array positions 1-5

the number in position 1 = s
subtract the number in position 2 from s
    IF the difference is a positive number
        the number in position 2 = s
    ELSE 
        the number in position 1 = s
repeat this in a loop for numbers in positions 3, 4, and 5, where s follows the above listed conditions
stop after all 5 numbers have been considered
s = smallest number

the number in position 1 = l
subtract the number in position 2 from l
    IF the difference is a positive number
        the number in position 1 = l
    ELSE 
        the number in position 2 = l
repeat this in a loop for numbers in positions 3, 4, and 5, where l follows the above listed conditions
stop after all 5 numbers have been considered
l = largest  

print "x is the average of the provided values."
print "s is the smallest number of the provided values."
print "l is the largest number of the provided values."
